# Converting a board to use the Proton C

Since the Proton C is a drop-in replacement for a Pro Micro we've made it easy to use. This page documents a handy automated process for converting keyboards, as well as documenting the manual process if you'd like to make use of Proton C features that aren't available on Pro Micros.

## Automatic Conversion

If a board currently supported in QMK uses a Pro Micro (or compatible board) and you want to use the Proton C, you can generate the firmware by appending `CONVERT_TO_PROTON_C=yes` (or `CTPC=yes`) to your make argument, like this:

    make 40percentclub/mf68:default CTPC=yes

You can add the same argument to your keymap's `rules.mk`, which will accomplish the same thing.

This exposes the `CONVERT_TO_PROTON_C` flag that you can use in your code with `#ifdef`s, like this:

```c
#ifdef CONVERT_TO_PROTON_C
    // Proton C code
#else
    // Pro Micro code
#endif
```

If you get errors about `PORTB/DDRB`, etc not being defined, so you'll need to convert the keyboard's code to use the [GPIO Controls](internals_gpio_control.md) that will work for both ARM and AVR. This shouldn't affect the AVR builds at all.

The Proton C only has one on-board LED (C13), and by default, the TXLED (D5) is mapped to it. If you want the RXLED (B0) mapped to it instead, add this like to your `config.h`:

    #define CONVERT_TO_PROTON_C_RXLED

## Manual Conversion

To use the Proton C natively, without having to specify `CTPC=yes`, you need to change the `MCU` line in `rules.mk`:

```
MCU = STM32F303
```

Remove these variables if they exist:

* `BOOTLOADER`
* `LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLE`
* `EXTRA_FLAGS`

Finally convert all pin assignments in `config.h` to the stm32 equivalents.

| Pro Micro | Proton C | | Proton C | Pro Micro | Comments |
|-----------|----------|-|----------|-----------|----------|
| `D3` | `A9` | | 5v | RAW (5v) |
| `D2` | `A10` | | GND | GND |
| GND | GND | | FLASH | RESET |
| GND | GND | | 3.3v | VCC | On a Pro Micro VCC can be 3.3v or 5v |
| `D1` | `B7` | | `A2` | `F4` |
| `D0` | `B6` | | `A1` | `F5` |
| `D4` | `B5` | | `A0` | `F6` |
| `C6` | `B4` | | `B8` | `F7` |
| `D7` | `B3` | | `B13` | `B1` |
| `E6` | `B2` | | `B14` | `B3` |
| `B4` | `B1` | | `B15` | `B2` |
| `B5` | `B0` | | `B9` | `B6` |
| `B0` (RX LED) | `C13` | | `C13` | `D5` (TX LED) | Use `CONVERT_TO_PROTON_C_RXLED` to control the LED C13 is assigned to.

You can also make use of several new pins on the extended portion of the Proton C:

| Left | | Right | Comments |
|------|-|-------|----------|
| `A4` | | `B10` | `A4` is shared with the speaker |
| `A5` | | `B11` | `A5` is shared with the speaker |
| `A6` | | `B12` | |
| `A7` | | `A14` (SWCLK) | `A14` is used for hardware debugging (SWD) |
| `A8` | | `A13` (SWDIO) | `A13` is used for hardware debugging (SWD) |
| `A15` | | RESET | Pull RESET high to reboot the MCU. This does not enter bootloader mode like a Pro Micro, it only resets the MCU. |
